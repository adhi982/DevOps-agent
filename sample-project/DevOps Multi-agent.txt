DevOps Multi-agent

## 🔧 What You’re Building (Non-ML Version)

You’re building a **multi-agent, rule-driven CI/CD system**, where each stage of a software delivery pipeline (like linting, testing, building, security scanning, deployment) is handled by an **autonomous microservice (agent)**. These agents are **coordinated by a central orchestrator agent**, which sequences tasks based on rules, pipeline configs, and real-time events.

No machine learning is used — the system works entirely via:

* Predefined logic for task order, retries, failures
* Kafka-based event queues
* Dockerized agents performing real tasks like linting, testing, building
* APIs and webhooks to integrate with GitHub, Kubernetes, Slack, etc.

---

## 🧱 Key Components 

### 1. **Orchestrator Agent**

* Written in FastAPI (Python)
* Listens to GitHub webhook events (e.g., push to main branch)
* Based on project rules (e.g., `project.yml`), dispatches tasks to Kafka queues
* Tracks success/failure of each agent and applies retry/rollback logic

### 2. **Kafka Message Bus (Event Broker)**

* Apache Kafka manages task queues
* Topics:

  * `pipeline.events`: triggers new pipeline execution
  * `agent.lint`, `agent.test`, `agent.build`, `agent.deploy`, etc.
  * `agent.results`: where agents post results (success/failure/logs)

### 3. **Microservice Agents (Dockerized)**

Each agent runs in a container and has a single responsibility:

| Agent Type     | Tools Used                               | Function                                                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lint Agent     | ESLint, Pylint                           | Run static analysis on codebase                           |
| Test Agent     | Jest, Pytest, Mocha                      | Run unit/integration tests and collect coverage           |
| Build Agent    | Docker, Kaniko                           | Build Docker image, tag it, push to registry              |
| Deploy Agent   | kubectl, Helm                            | Deploy to staging/production cluster                      |
| Security Agent | Trivy, Snyk                              | Scan containers/code for known vulnerabilities            |
| Report Agent   | Slack API, Prometheus/Grafana (optional) | Send real-time pipeline reports and visualize performance |

Each agent:

* Listens to its specific Kafka topic (e.g., `agent.lint`)
* Pulls source code from GitHub or receives file paths
* Executes the assigned job
* Publishes results to the orchestrator via `agent.results`

## ⚙️ Flowchart: End-to-End Process 

```plaintext
1. Dev pushes code → GitHub triggers webhook → Orchestrator receives request
2. Orchestrator checks pipeline config (e.g., JSON/YAML)
3. Orchestrator publishes tasks to Kafka (agent.lint, then agent.test, etc.)
4. Each agent consumes its task, performs the job, publishes results
5. Orchestrator reads results → continues to next step or retries on failure
6. Final status is logged and notified via Slack/Email
```

---

## 📋 Example Pipeline Config (pipeline.yml)

```yaml
pipeline:
  stages:
    - lint
    - test
    - build
    - security
    - deploy
  retry_on_failure: true
  notify_on_success: true
  deploy_environment: staging
```

The orchestrator parses this and dispatches each agent **sequentially or in parallel** as needed.

| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Language          | Python (FastAPI)              | Async, lightweight, easy to debug    |
| Messaging Queue   | Apache Kafka                  | High throughput, widely adopted      |
| Containerization  | Docker, Kaniko                | Fast builds, secure environments     |
| CI/CD Trigger     | GitHub Webhooks               | Standard VCS trigger                 |
| Deployment        | Kubernetes + Helm             | Standard infra, auto-scaling         |
| Security Scanning | Trivy                         | Open-source, fast vulnerability scan |
| Reporting         | Slack API, Prometheus/Grafana | Real-time updates and dashboards     |

## 🧪 Testing the System (MVP Ready)

**Example Scenario:**

1. Dev pushes code to GitHub
2. Webhook triggers orchestrator
3. Lint agent → success
4. Test agent → failure on 2 tests
5. Retry 1 triggered
6. Success → Build agent → success
7. Security scan → one vulnerability (high)
8. Pipeline halted, notified on Slack with report

---

## 🔒 Security & Reliability

* Agents run in isolated containers (minimized attack surface)
* Orchestrator logs all agent actions with timestamps
* Internal fail-safe logic: if a stage fails N times, halt and alert

---

## 📦 Deliverables

1. **Codebase**: Orchestrator + Agents (Dockerized)
2. **Infra Setup**: Kafka, Kubernetes, GitHub Webhooks
3. **Pipeline Configs**: YAML format per project
4. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Logs, success/failure stats
5. **Slack Notification System**: Status alerts to team

---

## ✅ Summary

You’re not building an ML project — you’re building a **robust, event-driven, automated CI/CD pipeline** where:

* **Every pipeline task is an agent**
* **One orchestrator controls everything**
* **It scales effortlessly**
* **And reduces manual intervention to near zero**

> 🔁 Later, if you want to evolve it into a smart pipeline, **ML models can be plugged in modularly**. But this version alone is fully powerful, 100% DevOps-ready, and perfect for MVP.
